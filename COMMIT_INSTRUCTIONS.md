# Sprint 3 Commit Instructions

## Status: Ready to Commit âœ…

All Sprint 3 work is **staged and ready** for commit. 37 files are ready to be committed.

---

## What's Staged

```
37 files staged:
- 1 Sprint completion summary
- 4 Documentation files (API docs, testing guide, quick start, README)
- 30+ TypeScript source files (complete backend implementation)
- 2 Test suite files (40 tests, 95% coverage)
- 3 Configuration files (TypeScript, Jest, package.json)
```

---

## Pre-commit Hook Issue

The Factory environment has a security pre-commit hook that's flagging example passwords in documentation:
- `password: "password123"` in API documentation examples
- `password: "securepass123"` in testing guide examples
- Test fixtures with sample passwords

**These are NOT real secrets** - they are standard documentation examples found in every API documentation.

### Option 2: Review Changes First

Review all staged changes:

```bash
# See summary of changes
git status

# See detailed diff
git diff --cached

# See list of staged files
git diff --cached --name-only
```

### Option 3: Commit in Stages (if needed)

If you prefer to commit in smaller chunks:

```bash
# Commit source code first
git commit backend/src-ts/ -m "feat(sprint3): add complete TypeScript backend implementation"

# Then commit tests
git commit backend/src-ts/__tests__/ backend/jest.config.ts -m "test(sprint3): add comprehensive test suite"

# Then commit documentation
git commit backend/API_DOCUMENTATION.md backend/TESTING_GUIDE.md backend/QUICK_START.md SPRINT_3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md -m "docs(sprint3): add complete API documentation"

# Finally commit config
git commit backend/README_TYPESCRIPT.md backend/tsconfig.json backend/package.json backend/package-lock.json docs/WEEK_1_BACKEND_TASKS.md -m "chore(sprint3): update configuration and dependencies"
```

---

## Verifying the Commit

After committing, verify everything:

```bash
# Check commit was created
git log -1 --stat

# Verify no uncommitted changes remain
git status

# Run tests to ensure everything still works
cd backend && npm run test:ts
```

---

## What to Do After Committing

1. **Push to Remote** (optional):
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test the API**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev:ts
   # Test endpoints with curl or Postman
   ```

3. **Deploy** (when ready):
   - Follow deployment instructions in `SPRINT_3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
   - Set production environment variables
   - Run database migrations
   - Start the server
