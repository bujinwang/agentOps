### Automated Cleanup Script

#### Usage
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/cleanup-n8n-workflows.sh

# Run complete cleanup
./scripts/cleanup-n8n-workflows.sh

# Validate only (no cleanup)
./scripts/cleanup-n8n-workflows.sh --validate

# Create backup only
./scripts/cleanup-n8n-workflows.sh --backup

# Rollback cleanup
./scripts/cleanup-n8n-workflows.sh --rollback
```

#### Cleanup Steps
1. **Validation**: Verify all conversions are working
2. **Testing**: Test Express.js services functionality
3. **Backup**: Create comprehensive backup of n8n workflows
4. **Stop Services**: Gracefully stop n8n containers
5. **Remove Files**: Clean up n8n workflow files and configurations
6. **Update Documentation**: Remove n8n references from docs
7. **Docker Cleanup**: Remove unused Docker resources
8. **Final Verification**: Confirm cleanup success

### Manual Cleanup Steps

#### 1. Stop N8N Services
```bash
# Stop n8n containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.n8n.yml down

# Remove n8n containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a | grep n8n | awk '{print $1}')

# Remove n8n images
docker rmi $(docker images | grep n8nio/n8n | awk '{print $3}')
```

#### 2. Backup N8N Data
```bash
# Create backup directory
BACKUP_DIR="backups/n8n_cleanup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup workflows
cp -r n8n-workflows "$BACKUP_DIR/"

# Backup configurations
cp docker-compose.n8n.yml "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp .env.n8n "$BACKUP_DIR/" 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### 3. Remove N8N Files
```bash
# Remove workflow files
rm -rf n8n-workflows/

# Remove configuration files
rm -f docker-compose.n8n.yml
rm -f .env.n8n
rm -f n8n-config.json

# Remove n8n directory
rm -rf .n8n/
```

#### 4. Update Project Files
```bash
# Remove n8n references from docker-compose.yml
sed -i '/n8n:/,/^$/d' docker-compose.yml

# Update README.md
sed -i '/n8n/d' README.md
sed -i '/N8N/d' README.md

# Update package.json scripts
npm uninstall n8n 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### 5. Clean Docker Resources
```bash
# Remove unused networks
docker network prune -f

# Remove dangling images
docker image prune -f

# Remove unused volumes (careful!)
# docker volume prune -f
```

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback
If issues arise after cleanup, use the automated rollback:

```bash
# Rollback cleanup
./scripts/cleanup-n8n-workflows.sh --rollback
```

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. **Stop Express.js Services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Restore N8N Files**
   ```bash
   cp -r backups/n8n_cleanup_*/n8n-workflows ./
   cp backups/n8n_cleanup_*/docker-compose.n8n.yml ./
   cp backups/n8n_cleanup_*/.env.n8n ./ 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

3. **Restart N8N Services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.n8n.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Verify Functionality**
   ```bash
   # Test n8n web interface
   curl -f http://localhost:5678/healthz
   ```
