# Story 2.2: Optimize Responsive Design

## Status: Ready for Development

## Story

As a user of the Real Estate CRM app,
I want the app to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations,
So that I can have a consistent and optimal experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Layout adaptation (mobile/tablet/desktop) - App layouts automatically adapt to mobile (320-767px), tablet (768-1023px), and desktop (1024px+) screen sizes with appropriate component sizing and spacing

2. Navigation/spacing for orientations - Navigation elements and spacing adjust appropriately for portrait and landscape orientations on all device types

3. Text sizes and touch targets - Text scales appropriately for readability and touch targets meet minimum 44px requirements across all screen sizes

4. Key user flows on all devices - Critical user journeys (login, lead creation, task management) work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop

5. Material Design compatibility - Responsive implementation maintains Material Design principles and component consistency

6. Component API patterns - Existing component APIs remain backward compatible with optional responsive props

7. Theme system integration - Responsive design integrates with existing theme system without conflicts

8. Testing coverage - 90%+ test coverage for responsive functionality with unit, integration, and manual testing

9. Documentation updates - Responsive design patterns and breakpoints documented for future development

10. No regression - All existing functionality continues to work without changes to user experience
