## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with existing property_media table
- **API**: RESTful endpoints following existing patterns
- **Frontend**: React Native with existing Material Design components
- **Storage**: Need to integrate with cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication and file access control

### Technical Context
- **Technology Stack**: React Native, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, n8n workflows
- **Existing Patterns**: Material Design 3, custom hooks, service layer architecture
- **Performance Requirements**: Fast image loading, efficient media handling
- **Security**: Secure file uploads, access control, file type validation
- **Mobile Features**: Camera integration, offline capabilities, touch gestures

### Media Storage Architecture
```typescript
// Cloud storage integration needed
interface MediaStorageConfig {
  provider: 'aws-s3' | 'cloudinary' | 'firebase';
  bucket: string;
  region: string;
  cdnUrl: string;
  maxFileSize: number;
  allowedTypes: string[];
}

// Media processing pipeline
interface MediaProcessingOptions {
  resize: boolean;
  compress: boolean;
  generateThumbnails: boolean;
  optimizeForWeb: boolean;
  createVariants: boolean;
}
```

### Component Architecture
- **MediaUpload**: Drag-and-drop upload component
- **MediaGallery**: Grid/carousel media display
- **MediaViewer**: Full-screen media viewer
- **MediaEditor**: Edit media metadata
- **MediaSync**: Offline sync management
