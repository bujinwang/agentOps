## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible property attributes
- **Backend**: n8n workflows for MLS integration and data processing

- **External Services**: MLS APIs, image optimization services, mapping services
- **Mobile Features**: Offline data sync, camera integration, location services

### Performance Requirements
- Fast property search with sub-second response times
- Efficient media loading and caching
- Smooth scrolling through property galleries
- Background sync for MLS data updates

### Security Considerations
- Secure file upload and storage
- MLS data access controls
- Property information privacy
- API rate limiting and authentication

## Dependencies
