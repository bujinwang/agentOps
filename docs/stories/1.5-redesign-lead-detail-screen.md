# Story 1.5: Redesign Lead Detail Screen

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a real estate agent,
I want an improved lead detail screen with better information presentation and user actions,
So that I can more effectively view and interact with lead information.

## Context Source

This is a brownfield enhancement to redesign the lead detail screen in the existing Real Estate CRM React Native app. The app currently has a functional lead detail screen but can benefit from improved visual hierarchy, better information presentation, and enhanced user actions using the established design system.

## Enhancement Scope

**Current State:**
- LeadDetailScreen.tsx exists at `frontend/src/screens/leads/LeadDetailScreen.tsx`
- Material Design components are used throughout the app
- Basic lead information display and actions are functional
- Room for improvement in visual hierarchy and user experience

**Enhancement Areas:**
- Improved visual hierarchy for better information presentation
- Enhanced user actions and interaction patterns
- Better layout organization using established design system
- Micro-animations for improved user feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Information presentation improved with better visual hierarchy using established design system
2. User actions enhanced for better usability and accessibility
3. Layout updates enhance readability and interaction patterns

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing lead functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New design follows existing Material Design pattern from MaterialLeadCard.tsx
6. Integration with lead API maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Change is covered by appropriate tests
8. Documentation is updated if needed
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing Patterns to Follow

**Component Structure:**
- Follow existing Material Design component patterns in `frontend/src/components/`
- Use established design system components and tokens
- Maintain TypeScript interfaces for component props

**Screen Layout:**
- Follow existing screen layout patterns in `frontend/src/screens/leads/`
- Use established navigation and header patterns
- Maintain responsive design principles

**API Integration:**
- Use existing lead API service patterns in `frontend/src/services/`
- Maintain current API endpoint usage and data structures
- Preserve existing error handling patterns

### Integration Approach

**Screen Updates:**
- Update `frontend/src/screens/leads/LeadDetailScreen.tsx` with improved layout
- Enhance visual hierarchy using design system typography and spacing
- Improve user action buttons and interaction patterns

**Component Integration:**
- Use existing Material Design components with enhanced styling
- Integrate with established design system tokens
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing component APIs

**Navigation Integration:**
- Preserve existing navigation patterns and transitions
- Enhance user feedback with micro-animations
- Maintain accessibility standards

### Technical Constraints

**Must Maintain:**
- Existing component APIs and props
- Current navigation and routing patterns
- API integration and data flow
- Material Design component compatibility

**Can Enhance:**
- Visual presentation and hierarchy
- User interaction patterns
- Animation and feedback systems
- Accessibility features

### Missing Information

None identified - all technical context is available in existing codebase.
