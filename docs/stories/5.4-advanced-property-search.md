## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with existing properties table and MLS fields
- **API**: RESTful endpoints following existing patterns
- **Frontend**: React Native with existing Material Design components
- **Search**: Full-text search capabilities with PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis integration for search result caching

### Technical Context
- **Technology Stack**: React Native, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Existing Patterns**: Service layer architecture, custom hooks, error handling
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-500ms search response times
- **Scalability**: Handle large property datasets efficiently
- **Search Features**: Fuzzy matching, relevance scoring, faceted search

### Search Architecture
```typescript
// Search Query Interface
interface PropertySearchQuery {
  query?: string; // Full-text search
  location?: {
    address?: string;
    city?: string;
    state?: string;
    zipCode?: string;
    radius?: number; // miles
  };
  priceRange?: {
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
  };
  propertyTypes?: string[];
  bedrooms?: {
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
  };
  bathrooms?: {
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
  };
  squareFeet?: {
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
  };
  yearBuilt?: {
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
  };
  features?: string[]; // pool, garage, etc.
  mlsStatus?: string[];
  sortBy?: 'relevance' | 'price_asc' | 'price_desc' | 'date_desc' | 'date_asc';
  page?: number;
  limit?: number;
}

// Search Result Interface
interface SearchResult {
  properties: Property[];
  totalCount: number;
  facets: SearchFacets;
  executionTime: number;
  query: PropertySearchQuery;
}

// Search Facets for Filtering
interface SearchFacets {
  propertyTypes: { [type: string]: number };
  priceRanges: { [range: string]: number };
  bedroomCounts: { [count: string]: number };
  cities: { [city: string]: number };
  mlsStatuses: { [status: string]: number };
}
```

### Component Architecture
- **PropertySearchScreen**: Main search interface with filters
- **SearchFilters**: Advanced filtering component
- **SearchResults**: Result display with sorting and pagination
- **SavedSearches**: Saved search management
- **SearchHistory**: Recent search tracking
- **SearchAnalytics**: Search performance and trends
