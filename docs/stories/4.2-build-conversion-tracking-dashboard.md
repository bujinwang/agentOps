### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**

1. ✅ **Conversion funnel visualization** - Fully implemented with interactive ConversionFunnel component
   - Given: Real estate agent accesses analytics dashboard
   - When: Views conversion tracking section
   - Then: Sees visual funnel showing lead progression from scoring to deal closure

2. ✅ **Key conversion metrics and KPIs** - Implemented via ConversionMetricsCard component
   - Given: Agent views dashboard
   - When: Examines metrics section
   - Then: Sees conversion rates, drop-off points, and time-to-conversion metrics

3. ✅ **Interactive charts and graphs** - InteractiveChart component with click handlers
   - Given: Agent interacts with funnel visualization
   - When: Clicks on funnel stages or chart elements
   - Then: Sees detailed breakdowns and drill-down modals

4. ✅ **Real-time updates** - WebSocket integration via useWebSocketAnalytics hook
   - Given: Lead status changes in system
   - When: Agent views dashboard
   - Then: Sees live updates without manual refresh

5. ✅ **Drill-down capability** - Modal system for detailed lead analysis
   - Given: Agent clicks on conversion stage
   - When: Drill-down modal opens
   - Then: Views individual lead conversion paths and reasons

6. ✅ **Export functionality** - Report generation capability
   - Given: Agent completes conversion analysis
   - When: Requests export

**Medium Risk Items:**
- **Large dataset performance** - 1000+ leads may cause UI lag
  - Mitigation: Pagination and virtualization needed
- **WebSocket reliability** - Network interruptions could break real-time updates
  - Mitigation: Robust reconnection and offline queue

**Low Risk Items:**
- **Export functionality** - May have formatting issues with large reports
- **Mobile responsiveness** - React Native implementation needs device testing

### Gate Decision
