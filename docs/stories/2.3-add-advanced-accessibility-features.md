### Test Architecture Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive accessibility testing strategy with WCAG 2.1 AA focus
- Excellent manual testing coverage for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Integration of automated accessibility testing tools
- Clear separation between unit, integration, and manual testing
- Performance considerations for non-disabled users

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Add automated visual accessibility testing
- Include real device accessibility testing in device labs
- Add accessibility performance monitoring in production

### Code Quality Review

**Technical Approach: ✅ EXCELLENT**
- Uses React Native's AccessibilityInfo API appropriately
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance focus is industry-leading
- Clean integration with existing theme system for high contrast
- Maintains backward compatibility with optional props
- Good performance considerations for non-disabled users

**Architecture Compliance: ✅ EXCELLENT**
- Follows React Native accessibility best practices
- Integrates well with existing Material Design components
- Maintains established component API patterns
- Uses appropriate accessibility utilities and patterns

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Security: ✅ PASS**
- No security implications for accessibility features
- Safe handling of accessibility state and preferences
- No sensitive data exposure in accessibility implementations

**Performance: ⚠️ CONCERNS**
- Accessibility features must not impact performance for non-disabled users
- Need validation that accessibility calculations don't slow down the app
- Screen reader announcements should not cause performance degradation

**Reliability: ✅ PASS**
- Robust error handling for accessibility feature failures
- Graceful degradation when accessibility features are unavailable
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported accessibility features

**Maintainability: ✅ PASS**
- Clean separation between accessibility logic and UI components
- Good utility organization for accessibility features
- Clear documentation of accessibility implementation patterns
- TypeScript interfaces for accessibility props

### Testability Evaluation

**Controllability: ✅ EXCELLENT**
- AccessibilityInfo API can be easily mocked for testing
- Screen reader detection can be simulated in test environments
- Keyboard navigation can be programmatically tested

**Observability: ✅ EXCELLENT**
- Accessibility state changes are observable and testable
- Screen reader announcements can be verified in tests
- Focus management can be asserted programmatically

**Debuggability: ✅ GOOD**
- Clear logging opportunities for accessibility events
- Component-level accessibility debugging capabilities
- Test utilities for simulating accessibility scenarios

### Technical Debt Assessment

**Minimal Debt Introduced:**
- Follows established accessibility patterns and conventions
- Good abstraction of accessibility logic into utilities
- Clean integration with existing component architecture

**Recommendations:**
- Consider creating accessibility design system documentation
- Add accessibility prop validation utilities
- Document WCAG compliance decision rationale

### Standards Compliance Check

**WCAG 2.1 AA Standards: ✅ PASS**
