# Story: User Login Authentication Enhancement

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a real estate agent,
I want to securely log into the app so I can access my leads,
So that I can efficiently manage my prospects and close more deals.

## Context Source

This is a brownfield enhancement to the existing Real Estate CRM authentication system. The basic login functionality already exists with JWT authentication, PostgreSQL database, and React Native frontend. This story focuses on enhancing security, user experience, and reliability of the login process.

## Enhancement Scope

**Current State:**
- JWT-based authentication with 7-day token expiry
- bcrypt password hashing with configurable salt rounds
- React Native frontend with form validation
- Express.js backend with input validation
- n8n workflow handling login logic
- PostgreSQL user storage

**Enhancement Areas:**
- Security hardening and best practices verification
- User experience improvements for login flow
- Error handling and security feedback
- Session management optimization
- Authentication reliability improvements

## Acceptance Criteria

**Security Requirements:**
1. Login endpoint properly validates email format and password requirements
2. Failed login attempts are handled securely without revealing user existence
3. JWT tokens are properly signed and validated
4. Password verification uses secure bcrypt comparison
5. Authentication state is properly managed in React Native app

**User Experience Requirements:**
6. Login form provides clear validation feedback
7. Loading states are properly displayed during authentication
8. Error messages are user-friendly but don't compromise security
9. Successful login redirects to leads list or dashboard
10. Login credentials are securely stored for session persistence

**Integration Requirements:**
11. Authentication integrates properly with existing lead management system
12. API calls include proper JWT authorization headers
13. User data is correctly retrieved and displayed after login
14. Logout functionality properly clears authentication state
15. Existing user data (leads, tasks) is accessible after login

**Quality Requirements:**
16. Authentication tests cover login success and failure scenarios
17. Security tests verify JWT validation and password hashing
18. Frontend tests validate form behavior and error states
19. Integration tests verify end-to-end authentication flow
20. No regression in existing authentication functionality

## Technical Context

### Existing System Architecture

**Frontend (React Native):**
- Location: `frontend/src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx`
- Context: `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- API Service: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Validation: `frontend/src/utils/validation.ts`

**Backend (Express.js):**
- Auth Routes: `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
- Auth Middleware: `backend/src/middleware/auth.js`
- User Model: `backend/src/models/User.js`
- Database Config: `backend/src/config/database.js`

**Workflow (n8n):**
- Login Workflow: `n8n-workflows/2-user-login.json`
- JWT Generation and validation logic

### Integration Points

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- From schema.sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**API Endpoints:**
- POST `/auth/login` - User authentication
- GET `/auth/profile` - Get current user profile
- POST `/auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token

### Security Considerations

**Current Security Measures:**
- bcrypt password hashing with configurable rounds
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiry
- Input validation using express-validator
- HTTPS required for production
- Secure token storage in AsyncStorage

**Potential Security Enhancements:**
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Security headers verification
- Token refresh mechanism validation
- Secure logout with token blacklisting

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Enhancements:**
- Form validation improvements
- Error message enhancements
- Loading state optimizations
- User experience refinements

**Medium Risk Enhancements:**
- Security header additions
- Token refresh improvements
- Session management optimizations

**High Risk Enhancements:**
- Authentication flow changes
- Database schema modifications
- Breaking API changes

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing Patterns to Follow

**Authentication Flow:**
- Use existing AuthContext pattern for state management
- Follow API service pattern in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Maintain JWT token storage pattern in AsyncStorage
- Use existing bcrypt verification in backend

**Error Handling:**
- Follow existing error handling patterns in auth routes
- Use consistent error response format
- Maintain security by not revealing sensitive information

**Database Access:**
- Use existing User model methods
- Follow PostgreSQL query patterns
- Maintain transaction safety

### Integration Approach

**Frontend Integration:**
- LoginScreen already exists with proper form handling
- AuthContext manages authentication state correctly
- API service handles HTTP requests with proper error handling

**Backend Integration:**
- Auth routes are properly implemented with validation
- JWT middleware is configured correctly
- User model provides secure password verification

**Database Integration:**
- PostgreSQL connection is properly configured
- User table schema supports authentication requirements
- Password hashing uses industry standard bcrypt

### Technical Constraints

**Must Maintain:**
- Existing JWT token format and validation
- Current password hashing mechanism
- Existing API endpoint signatures
- Database schema compatibility

**Can Enhance:**
- Form validation feedback
- Error message clarity
- Loading state management
- Security headers and rate limiting
