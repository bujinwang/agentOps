# Story 4.1: Automated Follow-up Workflows

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** real estate agent,
**I want** automated follow-up workflows triggered by lead scoring,
**so that** I can respond quickly to high-value leads and nurture them through the conversion process.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Workflow Triggers**: System automatically triggers follow-up sequences when leads reach configurable score thresholds
2. **Multi-Channel Communication**: Support for email, SMS, and in-app notifications in follow-up sequences
3. **Personalization**: Follow-up messages include lead-specific details (name, property preferences, timeline)
4. **Sequence Management**: Agents can create, edit, pause, and resume follow-up sequences
5. **Response Tracking**: System tracks which follow-up communications have been sent and opened
6. **Smart Timing**: Configurable delays between follow-up steps (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day)
7. **Lead Status Integration**: Workflows pause automatically when lead status changes to "Closed" or "Lost"

### Integration Requirements
8. **Lead Scoring Integration**: Seamless integration with existing lead scoring algorithm
9. **Notification System**: Uses existing notification infrastructure for consistent delivery
10. **CRM Integration**: Updates lead records with follow-up activity and engagement metrics

### Quality Requirements
11. **Performance**: Follow-up triggers execute within 5 minutes of score threshold being reached
12. **Reliability**: 99% delivery success rate for follow-up communications
13. **Configurability**: No-code workflow builder for agents to customize sequences
14. **Analytics**: Track conversion rates and engagement metrics for each workflow step

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration
- **Lead Scoring**: Real-time scoring algorithm with configurable thresholds
- **Notification System**: Existing email/SMS/in-app notification infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with existing lead and communication tables
- **API**: RESTful endpoints following established patterns

### Technical Context
- **Technology Stack**: React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis (for queuing)
- **Performance Requirements**: <5 minute trigger execution, <2s workflow operations
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent workflows
- **Real-time**: Immediate workflow triggering on score changes

### Workflow Architecture
```typescript
interface WorkflowTrigger {
  id: string;
  scoreThreshold: number;
  triggerType: 'immediate' | 'delayed';
  delayMinutes?: number;
  conditions: WorkflowCondition[];
}

interface WorkflowStep {
  id: string;
  sequence: number;
  channel: 'email' | 'sms' | 'in_app';
  templateId: string;
  delayMinutes: number;
  conditions: StepCondition[];
}

interface WorkflowExecution {
  id: string;
  leadId: number;
  workflowId: string;
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  currentStep: number;
  startedAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Component Architecture
- **WorkflowBuilder**: Visual workflow creation interface
- **WorkflowTrigger**: Real-time score monitoring component
- **WorkflowExecutor**: Queue-based workflow execution engine
- **CommunicationTemplates**: Template management system
- **WorkflowAnalytics**: Performance and engagement tracking
