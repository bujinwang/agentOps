# Story 4.1: Automated Follow-up Workflows

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** real estate agent,
**I want** automated follow-up workflows triggered by lead scoring,
**so that** I can respond quickly to high-value leads and nurture them through the conversion process.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Workflow Triggers**: System automatically triggers follow-up sequences when leads reach configurable score thresholds
2. **Multi-Channel Communication**: Support for email, SMS, and in-app notifications in follow-up sequences
3. **Personalization**: Follow-up messages include lead-specific details (name, property preferences, timeline)
4. **Sequence Management**: Agents can create, edit, pause, and resume follow-up sequences
5. **Response Tracking**: System tracks which follow-up communications have been sent and opened
6. **Smart Timing**: Configurable delays between follow-up steps (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day)
7. **Lead Status Integration**: Workflows pause automatically when lead status changes to "Closed" or "Lost"

### Integration Requirements
8. **Lead Scoring Integration**: Seamless integration with existing lead scoring algorithm
9. **Notification System**: Uses existing notification infrastructure for consistent delivery
10. **CRM Integration**: Updates lead records with follow-up activity and engagement metrics

### Quality Requirements
11. **Performance**: Follow-up triggers execute within 5 minutes of score threshold being reached
12. **Reliability**: 99% delivery success rate for follow-up communications
13. **Configurability**: No-code workflow builder for agents to customize sequences
14. **Analytics**: Track conversion rates and engagement metrics for each workflow step
