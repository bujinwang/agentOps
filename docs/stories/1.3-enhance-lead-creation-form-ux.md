## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture

**Frontend Architecture Patterns:**
- React Native application with TypeScript
- Material Design components for consistent UI
- Form validation using custom validation utilities
- API integration through apiService with error handling
- KeyboardAvoidingView for mobile keyboard management

**Current Form Implementation:**
- AddLeadScreen uses ScrollView with sectioned layout
- Validation handled by validateLeadForm and error display functions
- Form data managed with useState and handleInputChange
- Submission through apiService.createLead with loading states

**Integration Points:**
- apiService.createLead for backend integration
- validation.ts for form validation logic
- Material Design components for UI consistency
- Existing navigation patterns for form completion

**Existing Patterns to Maintain:**
- Form data structure with LeadForm interface
- API error handling through Alert.alert
- Validation error display below input fields
- Material Design styling and component usage

**Technology Stack:**
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- Material Design component library
- Custom validation utilities

### Previous Story Context

This story builds upon the established design system foundation (Story 1.1) and consistent loading states (Story 1.2) to enhance the lead creation experience. It focuses on UX improvements while maintaining all existing functionality and integrations.

### File Locations and Structure

**Primary File to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/screens/leads/AddLeadScreen.tsx` - Main form component

**Supporting Files to Reference:**
- `frontend/src/utils/validation.ts` - Validation logic
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - API integration
- `frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Form data types
- `RealEstateCRM_Architecture.md` - Component guidelines and architecture

### Testing Standards

**Unit Testing:**
- Test form validation improvements
- Test UI component rendering with new styles
- Test keyboard handling and input formatting

**Integration Testing:**
- Test complete form submission flow
- Test validation feedback display
- Test API integration remains functional

**Manual Testing:**
- Test form usability on different screen sizes
- Test keyboard navigation and input types
- Test accessibility with screen readers

### Security Considerations

- Form input validation prevents malicious data
- No sensitive data exposure in error messages
- Maintain existing input sanitization

### Performance Requirements

- Form rendering should remain fast
- Validation feedback should be responsive
- No impact on app startup or navigation performance

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required

- Form component rendering with new styles
- Validation feedback display logic
- Input formatting and keyboard type handling
- Accessibility improvements

### Integration Tests Required
