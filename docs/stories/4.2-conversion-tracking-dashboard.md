# Story 4.2: Conversion Tracking Dashboard

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** real estate agent or manager,
**I want** a comprehensive conversion tracking dashboard,
**so that** I can monitor lead progression through the sales funnel and identify conversion bottlenecks.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Conversion Funnel Visualization**: Interactive funnel chart showing lead progression from initial contact to deal closure
2. **Stage-by-Stage Analytics**: Detailed metrics for each conversion stage (contact → qualified → proposal → negotiation → closed)
3. **Time-to-Conversion Tracking**: Average time spent in each stage and total conversion cycle time
4. **Conversion Rate Calculations**: Real-time conversion rates between each stage with trend analysis
5. **Bottleneck Identification**: Automatic highlighting of stages with low conversion rates or long dwell times
6. **Lead Journey Tracking**: Individual lead progression visualization with timeline and touchpoints
7. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare conversion performance across agents, teams, or time periods

### Dashboard Features
8. **Interactive Filtering**: Filter dashboard by date range, agent, property type, lead source, and score range
9. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard updates automatically as leads progress through stages
10. **Drill-down Capability**: Click on any stage or metric to see detailed lead information
11. **Export Functionality**: Export conversion reports in PDF, Excel, and CSV formats
12. **Customizable Widgets**: Agents can customize which metrics and charts appear on their dashboard

### Integration Requirements
13. **Lead Scoring Integration**: Automatic stage progression based on scoring thresholds
14. **CRM Data Integration**: Pull conversion data from existing lead management system
15. **Workflow Integration**: Track conversion impact of automated follow-up workflows

### Quality Requirements
16. **Performance**: Dashboard loads within 3 seconds with real-time data
17. **Accuracy**: Conversion calculations accurate to within 1% of actual data
18. **Mobile Responsive**: Full functionality on mobile devices with touch-optimized interactions
19. **Data Freshness**: All metrics updated within 5 minutes of lead status changes

### Conversion Data Architecture
```typescript
interface ConversionStage {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  order: number;
  entryCriteria: StageCriteria;
  exitCriteria: StageCriteria;
  averageTime: number; // in days
  conversionRate: number;
}

interface ConversionEvent {
  id: string;
  leadId: number;
  fromStage: string;
  toStage: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  triggerType: 'automatic' | 'manual';
  triggerReason: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}

interface ConversionMetrics {
  totalLeads: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  averageTimeToConvert: number;
  stageMetrics: StageMetric[];
  bottleneckStages: string[];
  trendData: TrendPoint[];
}

interface StageMetric {
  stageId: string;
  leadsInStage: number;
  leadsConverted: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  averageTime: number;
  trend: 'improving' | 'declining' | 'stable';
}
```
