## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with existing properties and MLS data
- **API**: RESTful endpoints following existing patterns
- **Frontend**: React Native with existing Material Design components
- **Data Sources**: MLS integration and property database

### Technical Context
- **Technology Stack**: React Native, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Chart libraries
- **Performance**: Handle large datasets efficiently with pagination
- **Accuracy**: Statistical calculations with proper error handling
- **Real-time**: Market data updates and trend analysis

### CMA Data Architecture
```typescript
// Comparable Property Interface
interface ComparableProperty {
  id: number;
  address: string;
  price: number;
  price_per_sqft: number;
  bedrooms: number;
  bathrooms: number;
  square_feet: number;
  lot_size?: number;
  year_built?: number;
  property_type: string;
  sale_date: string;
  days_on_market: number;
  distance_miles: number;
  similarity_score: number;
  adjustments: PropertyAdjustment[];
}

// CMA Analysis Interface
interface ComparativeMarketAnalysis {
  subject_property: Property;
  comparables: ComparableProperty[];
  analysis_date: string;
  search_criteria: CMASearchCriteria;
  statistics: CMAStatistics;
  price_range: PriceRange;
  recommendations: CMARecommendation[];
  market_trends: MarketTrend[];
}

// Price Range Interface
interface PriceRange {
  low: number;
  high: number;
  average: number;
  median: number;
  confidence_level: number;
  standard_deviation: number;
  price_per_sqft_range: {
    low: number;
    high: number;
    average: number;
  };
}
```

### Component Architecture
- **ComparativeMarketAnalysisScreen**: Main CMA interface
- **ComparablePropertiesList**: List of comparable properties
- **CMAStatisticsCard**: Market statistics display
- **PriceRangeChart**: Visual price range representation
- **MarketTrendChart**: Trend analysis visualization
- **CMAReportGenerator**: Report creation and export
