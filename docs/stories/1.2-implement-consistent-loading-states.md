# Story 1.2: Implement Consistent Loading States

## Status: In Progress

## Story

As a user of the Real Estate CRM app,
I want to see consistent loading states and skeleton screens throughout the app,
So that I have clear visual feedback during async operations and content loading, improving the overall user experience.

## Context Source

This is a brownfield enhancement to implement consistent loading states across the existing Real Estate CRM React Native app. The app currently has a LoadingScreen.tsx component but lacks consistent loading patterns across all screens and async operations.

## Enhancement Scope

**Current State:**
- LoadingScreen.tsx exists at `frontend/src/screens/LoadingScreen.tsx`
- Material Design components exist in `frontend/src/components/`
- Inconsistent loading feedback across different screens
- Some async operations lack loading indicators

**Enhancement Areas:**
- Consistent loading indicators for all async operations
- Skeleton screens for content loading
- Standardized loading patterns across all screens
- Appropriate loading state durations

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Loading indicators appear for all async operations (API calls, navigation, data fetching)
2. Skeleton screens display during content loading for lists and detail views
3. Consistent loading patterns implemented across all screens
4. Loading states provide appropriate feedback duration (not too fast, not too slow)

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New loading states follow existing Material Design patterns
7. Integration with existing async operations in services maintains current behavior
8. No breaking changes to existing component APIs

**Quality Requirements:**

9. Loading states are covered by appropriate tests
10. Performance impact is minimal (no heavy animations or computations)
11. Accessibility considerations included (screen reader support)
12. Offline functionality remains intact

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing Patterns to Follow

**Loading Screen Pattern:**
- Use existing LoadingScreen.tsx as reference for loading UI patterns
- Follow Material Design loading component patterns
- Maintain consistent spinner and progress indicator styles

**Async Operation Patterns:**
- Follow existing async patterns in `frontend/src/services/`
- Use existing error handling patterns with loading states
- Maintain current API service structure

**Component Integration:**
- Add loading props to existing components without breaking APIs
- Use React Native's ActivityIndicator and skeleton components
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns for component props

### Integration Approach

**Loading State Implementation:**
- Create reusable loading components in `frontend/src/components/common/`
- Add loading state management to existing screens
- Integrate loading states with async operations in services
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout

**Skeleton Screen Implementation:**
- Create skeleton components for list and detail views
- Use Material Design skeleton patterns
- Implement responsive skeleton layouts

**Async Operation Integration:**
- Wrap existing API calls with loading state management
- Add loading states to navigation transitions
- Maintain existing error handling with loading feedback

### Technical Constraints

**Must Maintain:**
- Existing component APIs and props
- Current async operation patterns
- Material Design component compatibility
- React Native performance standards

**Can Enhance:**
- Visual feedback consistency
- Loading state user experience
- Skeleton screen implementations
- Accessibility for loading states

### Missing Information

None identified - all technical context is available in existing codebase.
