# Story: Redesign Lead List Screen

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a real estate agent,
I want an improved lead list screen with better visual hierarchy and layout,
So that I can quickly scan and interact with leads more effectively.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/epics/lead-management-ux-enhancements.md
- Enhancement Type: UI/UX redesign
- Existing System Impact: Updates to frontend/src/screens/leads/LeadsListScreen.tsx

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Lead list displays with improved visual hierarchy using established design system
2. Layout updates enhance readability and user interaction patterns
3. User interactions are enhanced for better usability and accessibility

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing lead functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New design follows existing Material Design pattern from MaterialLeadCard.tsx
6. Integration with lead API maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Change is covered by appropriate tests
8. Documentation is updated if needed
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update frontend/src/screens/leads/LeadsListScreen.tsx to implement improved layout and interactions
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow Material Design components and patterns established in the design system
- **Key Constraints:** Maintain compatibility with existing navigation and API integration

## Dev Notes

### Testing

- Test file location: frontend/src/screens/leads/__tests__/LeadsListScreen.test.tsx
- Test standards: Jest for unit tests, React Test Renderer for component tests
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Native Testing Library
- Specific testing requirements: Test visual hierarchy changes, layout responsiveness, Material Design compliance
- Test data requirements: Mock lead data with various statuses and priorities
