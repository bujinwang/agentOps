# Story 4.1: Implement Conversion Tracking System

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a real estate agent,
I want to track lead conversions from initial contact to final sale,
So that I can measure the effectiveness of my lead management process and optimize conversion rates.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Conversion Event Tracking**: System captures key conversion events (contact made, showing scheduled, offer submitted, offer accepted, sale closed)
2. **Conversion Funnel Visualization**: Visual representation of conversion rates at each stage
3. **Lead Journey Mapping**: Complete timeline of all interactions and status changes for each lead
4. **Conversion Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics showing conversion rates, average time to conversion, and bottleneck identification
5. **Historical Conversion Data**: Ability to analyze conversion trends over time
6. **Integration with Lead Scoring**: Conversion data enhances lead scoring algorithm
7. **Automated Conversion Alerts**: Notifications when leads reach critical conversion stages

## Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Builds on completed lead scoring system (Epic 3)
- Integrates with existing lead management database schema
- Uses established n8n workflow patterns for backend automation
- Leverages existing React Native frontend architecture

**Technical Requirements:**
- Database: PostgreSQL with JSONB support for flexible conversion event storage
- Backend: n8n workflows for conversion event processing and automation
- Frontend: React Native components with Material Design 3
- Real-time: WebSocket integration for live conversion updates
- Analytics: Integration with existing analytics dashboard

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Database Schema Extensions

**New Tables:**
- `lead_conversions` - Primary conversion tracking table
- `conversion_events` - Individual conversion event log
- `conversion_funnels` - Configurable funnel definitions

**Enhanced Existing Tables:**
- `leads` table additions:
  - `conversion_status` - Current conversion stage
  - `conversion_start_date` - When conversion tracking began
  - `conversion_complete_date` - When conversion was completed
  - `conversion_value` - Monetary value of the conversion
  - `conversion_probability` - AI-calculated conversion likelihood

### API Endpoints Required

- `POST /webhook/leads/:leadId/conversion-events` - Log conversion events
- `GET /webhook/leads/:leadId/conversion-timeline` - Get conversion history
- `GET /webhook/analytics/conversions/funnel` - Get conversion funnel data
- `PUT /webhook/leads/:leadId/conversion-status` - Update conversion status

### Frontend Components Needed

- `ConversionTracker` - Main conversion tracking component
- `ConversionFunnel` - Visual funnel representation
- `ConversionTimeline` - Lead journey timeline
- `ConversionMetrics` - Dashboard metrics display

### Integration Points

- **Lead Scoring Service**: Conversion data feeds back into scoring algorithm
- **Analytics Dashboard**: New conversion metrics integration
- **Notification System**: Conversion milestone alerts
- **Workflow Automation**: Automated follow-ups based on conversion stage

## Dev Notes

**Database Design:**
- Use PostgreSQL JSONB for flexible event data storage
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Ensure data integrity with foreign key constraints
- Plan for scalable event logging

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints following existing patterns
- Proper error handling and validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting for high-frequency updates

**Frontend Architecture:**
- Follow existing React Native patterns
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper state management
- Ensure responsive design

**Real-time Features:**
- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Optimistic UI updates
- Conflict resolution for concurrent updates
- Fallback to polling when WebSocket unavailable

**Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient database queries for analytics
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Background processing for heavy calculations
- Optimized frontend rendering

## Testing

**Unit Tests:**
- Conversion event logging
- Status update logic
- Funnel calculation algorithms
