# Story: Implement Lead Scoring Algorithm

## Status: Done

## Story

As a real estate agent,
I want leads to be automatically scored based on their potential value and readiness to buy,
So that I can prioritize my time and efforts on the most promising opportunities.

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/epics/lead-scoring-analytics-epic.md

2. Scores are displayed prominently in lead list and detail views with visual indicators
3. Scoring updates automatically when lead information changes
4. Scoring model is configurable by admin users
5. Historical scoring data is maintained for trend analysis

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing lead API endpoints continue to work unchanged
7. Database schema extended with scoring fields (backward compatible)

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture

**Frontend Architecture Patterns:**
- React Native application with TypeScript
- Service layer pattern for business logic (LeadScoringService)
- Component-based architecture with Material Design
- Real-time data updates using React hooks and context

**Current Lead Management Implementation:**
- Leads stored with basic attributes (name, email, phone, budget, timeline, property preferences)
- Lead data managed through existing API service layer
- Material Design components used throughout lead screens
- Existing database schema supports lead CRUD operations

**Integration Points:**
- apiService for backend communication
- Existing lead data structure and validation
- Material Design component library
- Current navigation and screen flow patterns

**Existing Patterns to Maintain:**
- Service layer architecture for business logic
- Material Design component usage and theming
- API service patterns for backend integration
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

**Technology Stack:**
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- Material Design component library
- SQLite for local data storage
- Custom API service layer

### Previous Story Context

- Edge cases in scoring calculations

### Security Considerations

- Scoring data privacy and access controls
- No sensitive lead information exposed in scoring logic
- Secure storage of scoring configuration data
- Audit trail for manual score overrides

### Performance Requirements

- Scoring calculation: <500ms for individual leads
- Bulk scoring: <2 seconds for 100 leads
- UI updates: <100ms for score display changes
- Memory usage: Minimal impact on app performance

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
