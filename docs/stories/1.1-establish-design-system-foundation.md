# Story 1.1: Establish Design System Foundation

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer,
I want a centralized design system foundation with consistent colors, typography, spacing, and component library,
So that I can maintain uniform UI styling and theming across the React Native app.

## Context Source

This is a brownfield enhancement to establish a design system foundation for the existing Real Estate CRM React Native app. The app currently uses Material Design components but lacks a centralized design system for consistent theming and component reuse.

## Enhancement Scope

**Current State:**
- Material Design components exist in `frontend/src/components/`
- Basic theme files: `MaterialDesign.ts`, `MaterialDarkTheme.ts`
- Inconsistent styling across screens
- No centralized design tokens

**Enhancement Areas:**
- Centralized design tokens for colors, typography, spacing
- Reusable component library with consistent styling
- Theme system supporting light and dark mode
- Updated existing components to use new design system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Centralized design tokens are created for colors, typography, and spacing
2. Reusable component library is established with consistent styling
3. Theme system supports light and dark mode
4. All existing components are updated to use the new design system

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing Material Design components in `frontend/src/components/` continue to work unchanged
6. New design system integrates with existing theme files (`MaterialDesign.ts`, `MaterialDarkTheme.ts`)
7. Component library follows existing React Native and TypeScript patterns
8. No breaking changes to current screen layouts or functionality

**Quality Requirements:**

9. Design system is documented with usage examples
10. Changes are covered by appropriate tests
11. Performance impact is minimal
12. Accessibility standards are maintained

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing Patterns to Follow

**Component Structure:**
- Follow existing Material Design component patterns in `frontend/src/components/`
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

**Theme Integration:**
- Extend existing theme files (`MaterialDesign.ts`, `MaterialDarkTheme.ts`)
- Use React Native's built-in theme system
- Maintain backward compatibility with current theme usage

**Styling Patterns:**
- Use StyleSheet.create for performance
- Follow existing spacing and typography patterns
- Maintain responsive design principles

### Integration Approach

**Design System Foundation:**
- Create centralized design tokens in `frontend/src/styles/tokens.ts`
- Establish theme provider in `frontend/src/styles/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- Create reusable component library in `frontend/src/components/design-system/`

**Component Updates:**
- Update existing components to use new design system
- Maintain API compatibility for existing component usage
- Add theme support to all components

**Theme System:**
- Extend existing Material themes with new design tokens
- Implement theme switching functionality
- Ensure all components respond to theme changes

### Technical Constraints

**Must Maintain:**
- Existing component APIs and props
- Current screen layouts and functionality
- Material Design component compatibility
- React Native and TypeScript patterns

**Can Enhance:**
- Visual consistency across screens
- Theme switching capabilities
- Component reusability
- Design system documentation

### Missing Information

None identified - all technical context is available in existing codebase.

- **Mitigation:** Simple theme implementation with clear documentation
- **Rollback:** Disable theme switching if issues persist
- **Verification:** Theme switching works reliably across all components

## Success Metrics

- 100% existing component compatibility maintained
- < 5% performance impact on component rendering
- Successful theme switching across all screens
