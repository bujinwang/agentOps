# Story 4.3: Add Personalized Communication Templates

## Status
In Progress

## Story
**As a** real estate agent,
**I want** dynamic communication templates based on lead characteristics,
**so that** I can send personalized, relevant messages that improve engagement.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dynamic template system uses lead data for personalization
2. A/B testing framework for communication effectiveness
3. Template editor with preview and validation
4. Agent override capabilities for manual customization
5. Template library with categories and search
6. Integration with automated follow-up workflows
7. Existing communication functionality remains unchanged

## Dev Notes
### Existing System Integration
- **Communication System**: Extends existing email/SMS notification infrastructure
- **Lead Database**: Uses lead scoring and profile data for personalization
- **Template System**: Builds on existing notification templates
- **Workflow Engine**: Integrates with automated follow-up workflows

### Technical Context
- **Technology Stack**: React Native for editor, Node.js for processing
- **Existing Patterns**: Template rendering, data binding patterns
- **Performance Requirements**: Template rendering <100ms, personalization <200ms
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ templates with real-time personalization

### Integration Points
- Lead scoring data for personalization variables
- Existing notification service for delivery
- Automated workflow system for template selection
- Material Design components for editor interface

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for template parsing and rendering
- Integration tests for personalization logic
- A/B testing validation and statistical analysis
- Performance tests for template processing
- Accessibility tests for template editor
