- Connects to MLS providers using RETS protocol
- Automatically syncs property listings every 4 hours
- Downloads and stores property images in AWS S3
- Handles sync errors with retry logic
- Provides admin dashboard for sync monitoring

**Why it's critical:**
- Property data is core to real estate CRM functionality
- Manual data entry is not scalable
- Agents need current listing information
- Frontend property screens are waiting for data

**Acceptance Criteria:** 15 criteria covering sync, error handling, media storage, and performance

### Story 3.3: Automated Workflow Execution Engine
**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 weeks  
**Dependencies:** Story 3.1 (API foundation needed)  
**File:** `docs/stories/3.3-workflow-execution-engine.md`

**What it does:**
- Executes multi-step follow-up workflows automatically
- Supports trigger conditions (score changes, status changes, time-based)
- Sends emails and SMS with template rendering
- Creates tasks automatically based on workflow rules
- Tracks workflow performance and conversions

**Why it's critical:**
- Automated follow-ups are a core value proposition
- Prevents leads from falling through cracks
- Frontend workflow screens need backend execution
- Drives agent productivity and lead conversion

**Acceptance Criteria:** 15 criteria covering triggers, actions, templates, tracking, and analytics

### Story 3.4: Machine Learning Model Training and Deployment Pipeline
**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks  
**Dependencies:** Story 3.1 (API foundation), sufficient historical data  
**File:** `docs/stories/3.4-ml-model-training-pipeline.md`

**What it does:**
- Automatically extracts features from lead data
- Trains ML models weekly on historical conversion data
- Compares models and selects best performer
- Deploys models with A/B testing
- Monitors for model drift and triggers retraining

**Why it's critical:**
- Current lead scoring is static and rule-based
- ML improves prediction accuracy over time
- Enables data-driven lead prioritization
- Competitive advantage through intelligent automation

**Acceptance Criteria:** 15 criteria covering feature engineering, training, deployment, monitoring, and explainability

## Recommended Sprint Order

### Sprint 3.1 (Weeks 1-4)
**Focus:** Foundation and Core API
- ✅ Story 3.1: Backend API Migration (Weeks 1-4)

**Why this order:**
- Establishes solid backend foundation
- All other features depend on proper API layer
- Can be tested independently
- Unblocks frontend integration

**Deliverables:**
- All auth endpoints working with JWT
- All CRUD endpoints with validation
- 80%+ test coverage
- API documentation (Swagger)
- Zero downtime migration from n8n

---

### Sprint 3.2 (Weeks 5-9)
**Focus:** Property Data and Automation
- ✅ Story 3.2: MLS Integration (Weeks 5-9)
- ✅ Story 3.3: Workflow Engine (Weeks 6-10, parallel start)

**Why this order:**
- MLS integration provides data for property features
- Workflow engine can start in parallel after week 5
- Both critical for production readiness
- No dependencies between these two stories

**Deliverables:**
- Automated property sync from MLS
- Property images stored in S3
- Workflow execution engine operational
- Email/SMS automation working
- Admin dashboards for monitoring

---

### Sprint 3.3 (Weeks 10-13)
**Focus:** Intelligence Layer
- ✅ Story 3.4: ML Training Pipeline (Weeks 10-13)

**Why this order:**
- Requires data from previous sprints
- Can leverage completed API and workflow infrastructure
- Not blocking other features
- Adds intelligence layer on top of solid foundation

**Deliverables:**
- Automated weekly model training
- Model deployment with A/B testing
- Drift detection and monitoring
- Improved lead scoring accuracy
