# Test Coverage Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive test coverage strategy for the Real Estate CRM project, ensuring high-quality code through systematic testing approaches and coverage analysis.

## 🎯 Coverage Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Maintain 70%+ overall test coverage** across all metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **Achieve 80%+ coverage for critical business logic** (services, utilities, core components)
- **Ensure 90%+ coverage for high-risk areas** (authentication, payment processing, data validation)

### Coverage Thresholds
```javascript
// jest.config.js coverage thresholds
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 70,
    functions: 70,
    lines: 70,
    statements: 70
  }
}
```

## 📊 Coverage Metrics

### Coverage Types
- **Statements**: Executable statements that have been executed
- **Branches**: Decision points (if/else, switch) that have been tested
- **Functions**: Functions that have been called during testing
- **Lines**: Lines of code that have been executed

### Weighted Coverage Score
```
Overall Coverage = (Statements × 0.4) + (Branches × 0.3) + (Functions × 0.2) + (Lines × 0.1)
```

## 🛠️ Coverage Analysis Tools

### Primary Tools

#### 1. Jest Coverage Reporter
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Generate coverage with specific reporters
jest --coverage --coverageReporters=text,lcov,html,json
```

#### 2. Coverage Analysis Script
```bash
# Run comprehensive coverage analysis
node test-coverage-analysis.js
```

#### 3. Coverage Dashboard
```bash
# Open visual coverage dashboard
open coverage-dashboard.html
```

### Coverage File Structure
```
coverage/
├── coverage-final.json      # Raw coverage data
├── coverage-report.json     # Detailed analysis report
├── lcov-report/            # HTML coverage report
│   └── index.html
├── coverage-dashboard.html # Visual dashboard

```

## 📈 Coverage Analysis Process

### 1. Generate Coverage Data
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### 2. Run Analysis
```bash
node test-coverage-analysis.js
```

### 3. Review Dashboard

## 🔍 Coverage Gap Analysis

### Identifying Coverage Gaps

#### 1. Low Coverage Files
```javascript
// Files with < 50% coverage need immediate attention
const lowCoverageFiles = Object.entries(coverageData)
  .filter(([_, data]) => data.overall < 50)
  .sort((a, b) => a[1].overall - b[1].overall);
```

#### 2. Uncovered Lines
```javascript
// Identify specific lines that need testing
const uncoveredLines = Object.entries(coverageData)
  .filter(([_, data]) => data.s && data.statementMap)
  .map(([file, data]) => ({
    file,
    uncovered: Object.entries(data.s)
      .filter(([_, hits]) => hits === 0)
      .map(([stmtId]) => data.statementMap[stmtId])
  }));
```

#### 3. Branch Coverage Gaps
```javascript
// Find untested conditional branches
const untestedBranches = Object.entries(coverageData)
  .filter(([_, data]) => data.b)
  .map(([file, data]) => ({
    file,
    untested: Object.values(data.b)
      .flat()
      .filter(hits => hits === 0)
      .length
  }));
```

## 💡 Coverage Improvement Strategies

### 1. Test Case Prioritization

#### High Impact Tests
- **Happy Path Tests**: Core functionality (40% of tests)
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions (30% of tests)
- **Error Handling Tests**: Exception scenarios (20% of tests)
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions (10% of tests)

#### Test Categories by Risk
- **Critical**: Authentication, payment, data integrity
- **High**: Core business logic, user workflows
- **Medium**: UI interactions, data formatting
- **Low**: Utility functions, error messages

### 2. Code Coverage Techniques

#### Statement Coverage
```javascript
// Ensure all executable statements are tested
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should create user with valid data', () => {
    // Test all statements in createUser method
  });

  it('should handle invalid email', () => {
    // Test error handling statements
  });
});
```

#### Branch Coverage
```javascript
// Test all decision points
describe('ValidationService', () => {
  it('should validate email format', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('user@example.com')).toBe(true);  // if branch
    expect(validateEmail('invalid')).toBe(false);          // else branch
  });

  it('should handle empty input', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('')).toBe(false);  // empty string branch
    expect(validateEmail(null)).toBe(false); // null branch
  });
});
```

#### Function Coverage
```javascript
// Ensure all functions are called
describe('ApiService', () => {
  it('should call getUsers', () => {
    const mockGet = jest.fn();
    // Setup mock and call getUsers
    expect(mockGet).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### 3. Test Organization Strategies

#### Test File Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── UserProfile/
│   │   ├── UserProfile.tsx
│   │   └── __tests__/
│   │       ├── UserProfile.test.tsx
│   │       └── UserProfile.integration.test.tsx
├── services/
│   ├── userService.ts
│   └── __tests__/
│       ├── userService.test.ts
│       ├── userService.integration.test.ts
│       └── userService.e2e.test.ts
```

#### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions/components
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing

## 📊 Coverage Reporting

### Automated Reports

#### Daily Coverage Report
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run in CI/CD pipeline
npm run test:coverage
node test-coverage-analysis.js

# Send notifications for coverage drops
if [ $(jq '.summary.overall.percentage' coverage/coverage-report.json) -lt 70 ]; then
  echo "Coverage dropped below 70%"
  # Send notification
fi
```

#### Weekly Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate trend analysis
node scripts/coverage-trends.js

# Identify coverage improvements/regressions
# Generate actionable recommendations
```

## 🔧 Tools and Configuration

### Jest Configuration
```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
    '!src/**/__tests__/**',
    '!src/**/index.ts'
  ],
  coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
  coverageReporters: ['text', 'lcov', 'html', 'json'],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 70,
      functions: 70,
      lines: 70,
      statements: 70
    }
  }
};
```

### NPM Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:coverage:analysis": "node test-coverage-analysis.js",
    "test:coverage:dashboard": "open coverage-dashboard.html"
  }
}
```

## 📋 Best Practices

### Writing Testable Code
1. **Single Responsibility**: Functions should do one thing
2. **Dependency Injection**: Make dependencies injectable for mocking
3. **Pure Functions**: Prefer pure functions over side effects
4. **Interface Segregation**: Use interfaces for better testability

### Test Maintenance
1. **Regular Review**: Review and update tests with code changes
2. **Test Refactoring**: Keep tests clean and maintainable
3. **Documentation**: Document complex test scenarios
4. **Automation**: Automate test execution in CI/CD

### Coverage-Driven Development
1. **Write Tests First**: TDD approach for new features
2. **Coverage as KPI**: Track coverage in development metrics
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor coverage trends
4. **Quality Gates**: Block merges below coverage thresholds

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Low Branch Coverage
**Cause**: Missing test cases for conditional logic
**Solution**: Add test cases for all if/else branches and switch statements

### Issue: Hard-to-Test Code
**Cause**: Tight coupling and side effects
**Solution**: Refactor to use dependency injection and pure functions

### Issue: Slow Test Suite
**Cause**: Inefficient test setup and execution
**Solution**: Optimize test setup, use parallel execution, mock external dependencies

### Issue: Flaky Tests
**Cause**: Tests dependent on external state or timing
**Solution**: Use proper mocking, avoid timing dependencies, stabilize test data
