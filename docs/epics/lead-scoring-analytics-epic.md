# Epic: Lead Scoring and Analytics - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement intelligent lead scoring algorithms and comprehensive analytics dashboard to help real estate agents prioritize high-value leads and track performance metrics, transforming raw lead data into actionable business insights.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Enhanced lead management screens with improved UX (Stories 1.3-1.5), established design system foundation
- Technology stack: React Native, TypeScript, Material Design components, existing lead data structure
- Integration points: Lead API endpoints, existing database schema, Material Design components

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Lead scoring algorithm, analytics dashboard, performance metrics, data visualization components
- How it integrates: Builds upon existing lead management system while maintaining current data structures and APIs
- Success criteria: Automated lead prioritization, actionable performance insights, improved lead conversion rates

## Stories

1. **Story 3.1:** Implement Lead Scoring Algorithm
   - Create configurable scoring model based on lead attributes (budget, timeline, property type, location)
   - Implement real-time scoring calculation for new and updated leads
   - Add scoring visualization in lead detail and list views
   - Include scoring history and trend tracking

2. **Story 3.2:** Build Analytics Dashboard
   - Create comprehensive dashboard with key performance indicators
   - Implement data visualization components for lead metrics
   - Add filtering and date range selection capabilities
   - Include export functionality for reports

3. **Story 3.3:** Add Lead Performance Insights
   - Implement lead conversion tracking and analytics
   - Create performance comparison tools (agent vs team vs market)
   - Add predictive insights for lead quality assessment
   - Include actionable recommendations based on performance data

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing lead data structure remains unchanged
- [ ] Current API endpoints continue to work
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal on existing functionality
- [ ] Offline functionality remains intact

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Scoring algorithm might produce inaccurate results affecting agent decisions
- **Mitigation:** Implement scoring with transparency, allow manual overrides, include validation testing
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable scoring features if issues arise, revert to original lead display
- **Verification:** Scoring accuracy validated against historical conversion data

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Lead scoring algorithm produces accurate and useful results
- [ ] Analytics dashboard provides actionable business insights
- [ ] Performance metrics are reliable and informative
- [ ] Integration with existing lead management is seamless
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] No regression in existing lead functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Scoring Algorithm:** Implement flexible scoring model with configurable weights
- **Data Visualization:** Use Material Design chart components for consistency
- **Performance:** Optimize queries and calculations for mobile performance
- **Offline Support:** Ensure analytics work with cached data when offline

## Dependencies

- Lead Management UX Enhancements epic (Stories 1.3-1.5) - Completed
