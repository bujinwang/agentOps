# Epic: Medium-Term UX Enhancements - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enhance the Real Estate CRM React Native app with dark mode support, responsive design optimization, and advanced accessibility features to provide a consistent, inclusive user experience across different devices and user preferences, building upon the established design system foundation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: React Native app with established design system foundation (Story 1.1), consistent loading states (Story 1.2), and enhanced error messages (Story 1.3)
- Technology stack: React Native, TypeScript, Material Design components, Expo
- Integration points: All existing screens and components need to be updated to support dark mode themes, responsive layouts, and accessibility features

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Complete dark mode theme system, responsive design patterns for different screen sizes, advanced accessibility features (screen reader support, keyboard navigation, focus management, high contrast support)
- How it integrates: Builds upon existing design system and Material Design components while maintaining backward compatibility and following established patterns
- Success criteria: Improved accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), consistent user experience across screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), user preference for dark mode, measurable improvements in user satisfaction and app usability

## Stories

1. **Story 2.1:** Implement Dark Mode Support
   - Create comprehensive dark theme system extending existing Material themes
   - Implement theme switching functionality with user preference persistence
   - Update all existing components and screens to support dark mode
   - Add smooth theme transitions and system preference detection

2. **Story 2.2:** Optimize for Different Screen Sizes
   - Implement responsive design patterns for mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts
   - Create adaptive component sizing and spacing systems
   - Optimize navigation and layout for different screen orientations
   - Ensure consistent user experience across device types

3. **Story 2.3:** Add Advanced Accessibility Features
   - Implement comprehensive screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
   - Add keyboard navigation and focus management throughout the app
   - Create high contrast mode and adjustable text sizing
   - Add accessibility testing and validation tools

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material Design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (no heavy animations or processing)
- [ ] Offline functionality remains intact
- [ ] Existing component APIs maintain backward compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Theme and responsive changes might affect existing component layouts and user workflows
- **Mitigation:** Implement changes incrementally with feature flags, comprehensive testing, and user feedback loops
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to previous component versions if critical layout or functionality issues arise
- **Verification:** All existing screens continue to function properly with new features

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) met
- [ ] Responsive design verified across device types
- [ ] Dark mode working consistently across all screens
- [ ] User testing confirms improved experience

## Technical Notes

- **Design System Integration:** Extend existing design tokens and theme system from Story 1.1
- **Component Updates:** Update existing Material Design components to support new features
- **Theme System:** Build upon existing MaterialDesign.ts and MaterialDarkTheme.ts files
- **Testing:** Ensure all changes are covered by existing Jest test setup
- **Performance:** Maintain existing performance benchmarks with new features

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1 (Design System Foundation) - Must be completed
- Story 1.2 (Loading States) - Should be completed for consistent UX
- Story 1.3 (Error Messages) - Should be completed for consistent UX

## Priority
