# Epic 4: Lead Conversion Optimization - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Transform scored leads into closed deals by implementing automated follow-up workflows, comprehensive conversion tracking, and personalized communication strategies to increase conversion rates by 25% within 3 months.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Lead scoring algorithm with real-time scoring, analytics dashboard foundation
- Technology stack: React Native frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database
- Integration points: Lead scoring service, notification system, existing lead management workflows

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Automated follow-up workflows, conversion tracking dashboard, personalized communication templates, conversion funnel analytics
- How it integrates: Extends existing lead management system with conversion-focused features while maintaining compatibility with current scoring and analytics
- Success criteria: 25% increase in lead conversion rates, automated follow-up within 5 minutes of lead scoring, comprehensive conversion tracking across the entire sales funnel

## Stories

1. **Story 4.1: Implement Automated Follow-up Workflows**
   - Create configurable automated follow-up sequences based on lead scores
   - Implement email/SMS notification templates with personalization
   - Add workflow triggers for different lead score thresholds

2. **Story 4.2: Build Conversion Tracking Dashboard**
   - Develop comprehensive conversion funnel visualization
   - Track lead progression from scoring to deal closure
   - Add conversion rate analytics and bottleneck identification

3. **Story 4.3: Add Personalized Communication Templates**
   - Create dynamic template system based on lead characteristics
