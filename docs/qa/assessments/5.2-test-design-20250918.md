2. Service layer testing (dashboardService, exportService)
3. Type definition validation
4. Basic integration tests

### Phase 2: Feature Tests (Week 2)
1. Real-time update testing
2. Interactive component testing
3. Export functionality testing
4. Responsive design testing

### Phase 3: System Tests (Week 3)
1. End-to-end dashboard workflows
2. Performance testing and validation
3. Security testing
4. Offline capability testing

### Phase 4: ML Integration Tests (Week 4)
1. Predictive analytics accuracy testing
2. Recommendation engine validation
3. Model performance monitoring
4. Alert system testing

## Test Data Requirements

### Mock Data Sets
- 50 leads with complete scoring history
- 10 predictive analytics scenarios
- Various alert conditions and thresholds
- Performance test data (1000+ leads)

### Test Environments
- Local development with mock services
- Staging with real ML services
- Production-like performance testing

## Test Automation Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Component rendering and interactions
- Service method validation
- Type safety verification

### Integration Tests
- API integration testing
- WebSocket connection testing
- Data flow validation
- Cross-component interactions

### E2E Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Real-time feature validation
- Mobile responsiveness
- Export functionality

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with k6
- Memory usage monitoring
- Network performance validation
- Scalability testing

## Success Criteria

### Test Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for all components
- **Integration Tests**: All service interactions covered
- **E2E Tests**: All critical user journeys
- **Performance Tests**: All NFRs validated

### Quality Gates
- All P0 tests passing
- No critical bugs in core functionality
- Performance requirements met
- Security vulnerabilities resolved

## Risk Mitigation

### Testing Risks
- **Mock Data Accuracy**: Validate mocks against real data
- **Test Environment Differences**: Test in production-like environment
- **Async Operation Testing**: Proper handling of WebSocket and real-time updates

### Timeline Risks
- **Parallel Development**: Coordinate with feature development
- **Dependency Management**: Test incrementally as features complete
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize critical path testing

## Test Maintenance Plan

- **Regression Testing**: Automated test suite for CI/CD
- **Test Documentation**: Update tests with code changes
- **Performance Baselines**: Regular performance test execution
- **Test Data Refresh**: Keep test data current with schema changes

## Current Gap Analysis

**Immediate Needs**:
1. Set up testing framework and infrastructure
2. Create basic component tests
3. Implement service layer testing
4. Add integration test framework

**Critical Missing Tests**:
- All ML-related functionality
- Real-time update mechanisms
- Alert and notification systems
- Export and reporting features
- Performance and scalability validation

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks for complete test implementation
