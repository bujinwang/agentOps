## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ------------------- |
| TECH-001 | Complex search queries could have performance issues | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Optimize queries, add database indexes, implement query caching |
| PERF-001 | Large dataset handling may cause slow response times | Performance | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High | Implement pagination, add result caching, optimize database queries |
| DATA-001 | Inaccurate search results due to filtering edge cases | Data | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Add comprehensive test cases, validate filter combinations |
| SEC-001 | Potential SQL injection in search parameters | Security | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low | Use parameterized queries, input validation, ORM protection |
| BUS-001 | Search functionality may not meet real estate agent needs | Business | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low | User testing, feedback collection, iterative improvements |
| OPS-001 | Search analytics tracking may not work properly | Operational | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low | Test analytics integration, add monitoring |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Performance testing for complex search queries under load
- Database query optimization validation
- Response time monitoring for large result sets

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Integration tests for search result caching
- Load testing with large property datasets
- Query performance profiling

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Edge case testing for filter combinations
- Security testing for input validation
- Analytics data accuracy verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Optimize database queries and add proper indexing
- Implement efficient pagination and caching

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- SQL injection risk (low probability with ORM)
- Business fit risk (addressed through user feedback)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Search query response times
- Database query performance metrics
- Search result accuracy rates
- User search behavior analytics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Database grows significantly
- New search features added
- Performance issues reported
- User feedback indicates search problems
