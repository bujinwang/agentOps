**Current Status**: Not addressed

## Medium Risk Issues

### 6. Architecture Complexity (MEDIUM)
**Score: 4 (Medium)** - Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium
**Description**: Advanced features (approval workflows, bulk operations) not required
**Affected Components**: Database schema, business logic
**Mitigation Required**:
- Remove unnecessary features
- Simplify data model
- Document architectural decisions
**Current Status**: Not addressed

### 7. Missing Documentation (MEDIUM)
**Score: 4 (Medium)** - Probability: Low, Impact: Medium
**Description**: No API documentation or component usage examples
**Affected Components**: API endpoints, React components
**Mitigation Required**:
- Create OpenAPI documentation
- Add component documentation
- Create integration guides
**Current Status**: Not addressed

## Low Risk Issues

### 8. Maintenance Burden (LOW)
**Score: 2 (Low)** - Probability: Low, Impact: Low
**Description**: Large code files increase maintenance complexity
**Affected Components**: All implementation files
**Mitigation Required**:
- Break down large files into smaller modules
- Improve code organization
- Add comprehensive comments
**Current Status**: Not addressed

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- **Technical Debt**: 3 risks (Over-engineering, Architecture, Maintenance)
- **Security**: 1 risk (Security Vulnerabilities)
- **Performance**: 1 risk (Performance Issues)
- **Configuration**: 1 risk (Hardcoded Configuration)
- **Testing**: 1 risk (Missing Test Coverage)
- **Documentation**: 1 risk (Missing Documentation)

### By Component
- **Database**: 3 risks (Over-engineering, Performance, Architecture)
- **API Service**: 2 risks (Configuration, Security)
- **TypeScript Types**: 1 risk (Over-engineering)
- **Testing**: 1 risk (Missing Test Coverage)
- **Documentation**: 1 risk (Missing Documentation)

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- Unit test coverage for all services (target: 80%)
- Integration tests for status change workflows
- Database function tests for all stored procedures
- Component tests for React Native components

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- Configuration tests for different environments
- Security tests for authentication and authorization
- Performance tests for status history queries
- Load tests for bulk operations

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Documentation tests (API spec validation)
- Architecture compliance tests
- Maintenance burden monitoring

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All Critical risks (score ≥ 9)
- All High risks (score ≥ 6)
- Test coverage ≥ 70%

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Medium risks with documented workarounds
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks
- None - All identified risks require mitigation

## Monitoring Requirements

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Test coverage metrics (target: ≥80%)
- Performance metrics for status operations
- Security monitoring for authentication attempts
- Error rates for status change operations

### Alert Triggers
- Test coverage drops below 70%
- Status change operations exceed 2 second response time
- Authentication failures exceed normal thresholds
- Database query performance degrades

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New features added to status management
- Performance issues reported in production
- Security incidents occur
- Code complexity increases significantly
- Team composition changes

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **CRITICAL**: Begin test implementation
2. **HIGH**: Fix hardcoded configuration
3. **HIGH**: Address security vulnerabilities

### Short-term Actions (2 Weeks)
1. **HIGH**: Refactor over-engineered components
2. **MEDIUM**: Optimize database performance
3. **MEDIUM**: Add API documentation

### Long-term Actions (1 Month)
1. **MEDIUM**: Simplify architecture
2. **LOW**: Improve code maintainability
3. **LOW**: Enhance documentation

## Overall Assessment

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Requires immediate attention to critical issues before production deployment. The implementation demonstrates excellent feature coverage but suffers from significant quality and maintainability issues that must be addressed.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement comprehensive test suite
2. Fix configuration and security issues
3. Refactor over-engineered components
4. Re-review after improvements
