# System Integration Test Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive integration testing for all completed stories to validate end-to-end functionality and cross-story integration.

## Test Environment Setup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with test schema
- **Redis**: In-memory Redis for caching and queues
- **External APIs**: Mocked external services (property data, social media, credit scoring)
- **Test Data**: 10,000+ realistic lead records with historical conversion data

## Completed Stories Under Test
1. **Story 5.1**: ML Lead Scoring Engine
2. **Story 5.2**: Predictive Lead Insights Dashboard
3. **Story 5.3**: Automated Lead Enrichment
4. **Story 4.1**: Automated Follow-up Workflows
5. **Story 4.2**: Conversion Tracking Dashboard

## Integration Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Lead Lifecycle
**Objective**: Validate end-to-end lead processing from creation to conversion
**Steps**:
1. Create new lead via API
2. Verify ML scoring triggers automatically (<5s)
3. Check lead enrichment with property/social data
4. Validate workflow triggers based on score
5. Monitor conversion tracking updates
6. Verify dashboard reflects all changes in real-time

### Scenario 2: High-Volume Lead Processing
**Objective**: Test system performance with concurrent lead processing
**Steps**:
1. Bulk import 1000 leads simultaneously
2. Monitor ML scoring queue performance
3. Validate enrichment processing doesn't block scoring
4. Check workflow trigger timing and reliability
5. Verify dashboard performance with large dataset

### Scenario 3: Real-Time Dashboard Updates
**Objective**: Validate WebSocket real-time updates across all components
**Steps**:
1. Open dashboard in multiple browser sessions
2. Create/update leads and monitor real-time updates
3. Verify score changes trigger dashboard refreshes
4. Test enrichment completion notifications
5. Validate workflow status updates in real-time

### Scenario 4: ML Model Integration
**Objective**: Test ML scoring integration with enrichment and workflows
**Steps**:
1. Verify feature engineering uses enriched data
2. Test model retraining with new conversion data
3. Validate score changes trigger appropriate workflows
4. Check model performance monitoring updates
5. Test A/B testing framework integration

### Scenario 5: Error Handling and Recovery
**Objective**: Test system resilience and error recovery
**Steps**:
1. Simulate external API failures
2. Test ML service degradation scenarios
3. Verify fallback scoring mechanisms
4. Check error logging and monitoring
5. Validate system recovery after failures

## Performance Test Scenarios

### Load Test 1: Concurrent Users
- **Target**: 2000+ simultaneous dashboard users
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Metrics**: Response time <2s, error rate <1%

### Load Test 2: Lead Processing Throughput
- **Target**: 1000 leads/minute processing
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Metrics**: ML scoring <5s, enrichment <30s

### Load Test 3: Database Performance
- **Target**: 10,000+ lead queries per minute
- **Duration**: 20 minutes
- **Metrics**: Query time <100ms, connection pool utilization

## Data Integrity Tests

### Test 1: Cross-Story Data Consistency
- Verify lead scores consistent across all stories
- Check enrichment data properly linked to leads
- Validate workflow execution data integrity
- Confirm conversion tracking accuracy

### Test 2: Transaction Integrity
- Test database transactions across multiple services
- Verify rollback behavior on failures
- Check data consistency after system restarts

## Security Integration Tests

### Test 1: Authentication Flow
- Test JWT token validation across all APIs
- Verify role-based access controls
- Check secure WebSocket connections

### Test 2: Data Privacy
- Validate GDPR compliance in enrichment
- Test data deletion and right-to-be-forgotten
- Check audit trail completeness

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Integration Tests (Day 1)
- Individual service integration tests
- API endpoint integration validation
- Database integration testing

### Phase 2: End-to-End Workflow Tests (Day 2)
- Complete lead lifecycle testing

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **ML Service Integration**: Comprehensive testing of scoring pipeline
2. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket connection reliability
3. **Database Performance**: Query optimization under load
4. **External API Dependencies**: Mocking and failure simulation

### Contingency Plans
1. **ML Service Failure**: Fallback to rule-based scoring
2. **Database Issues**: Connection pooling and retry logic
3. **External API Outages**: Caching and graceful degradation
4. **WebSocket Failures**: Polling fallback mechanism
